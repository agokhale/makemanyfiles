usage ./gomakefiles <startcursor> <endcursor>

will make a clean directory based on the time stamp and start writing files into it starting with nonce0 ... ending in nonce<endcursor> Each file will contain  an unisgned long long's worth of sentinal indicating which file it should belong to; this should make the file content to file handle mapping trivial to postcompute and prove. 

This tool should build on freebsd 10.3 amd64 abi familiy and run on TrueNAS 9.10.    

We generate files at rates in excess of 10K/sec on Z20 Truenas hardware. By specifing parallel invocations with non overlapping cursor addresses;  higher rates are likely. 

example:
./gomakefiles 0 0x1000
<wait...>
#hd noncedir582F781E/nonceFF  
00000000  ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                           |........| 
00000008
